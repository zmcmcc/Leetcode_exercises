/*Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.

For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
*/

/*Method: Delete all rows where id is higher than the first distinct one.*/


DELETE p1.*
FROM Person AS p1
INNER JOIN Person AS p2
ON p1.Email == p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;
